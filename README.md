# FreeCodeCamp Drum Machine Challenge


so much events. it was like a 100 leaf cake of events.

## Process:

The logic.

- So, this was the biggest thing on the project, the event handling was the main focus here, i tought it would be really hard, since i was just coming from vanilla js, so it was already thinking of bubbling event delegation and all sorts of stuff, but I fouynd out React is amaizing and takes care of that for me..


2. sound and hover Memory leak

- so, the biggest struggle i had with this, was a memory leak that if you furiosly spammed any button it would stay stuck on the hover high-light feed back 
(it was fixed pretty easy with a cleanup fuction of use effect, but  i was still getting the hang of React)

3. On/off switch

- The On/Off switch was a pretty simple task once i got the hang of clean up functions and a little back tracking to see where would be the best place to make the short circuit
